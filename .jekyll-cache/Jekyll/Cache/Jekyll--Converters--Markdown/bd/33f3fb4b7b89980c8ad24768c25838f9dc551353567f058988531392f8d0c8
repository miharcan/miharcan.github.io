I"¶<p align="justify">I am a research fellow at the Data Science Institute (DSI) and Adjunct Lecturer at the School of Computer Science at NUI Galway. I am working in the Unit for Natural Language Processing (UNLP) under the supervision of Dr Paul Buitelaar, where my main research topic focuses on terminology and ontology/knowledge graph translation with neural machine translation. Recently, I am also following the work on dialogue systems and natural language generation with multi-modal data. I am primarily funded by the nationwide Insight SFI Research Centre for Data Analytics, which is hosted within DSI. </p>
