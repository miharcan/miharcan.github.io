I"-<p align="justify">I am a research fellow at the Data Science Institute (DSI) and Adjunct Lecturer at the School of Computer Science at NUI Galway. I am working in the Unit for Natural Language Processing (UNLP) under the supervision of Dr Paul Buitelaar, where my main research topic focuses on terminology and knowledge graph injection into neural machine translation architecture. Recently, I am also following the work on dialogue systems and natural language generation with multi-modal data. I am primarily funded by the nationwide Insight SFI Research Centre for Data Analytics, which is hosted within DSI. </p>
