I am working in the Unit for Natural Language Processing (UNLP) under the supervision of Dr Paul Buitelaar, where my main research topic focuses on terminology and ontology/knowledge graph translation with neural machine translation. Recently, I am also following the work on dialogue systems and natural language generation with multi-modal data.
