There, I was an active member of the Unit for Natural Language Processing (UNLP) led by Paul Buitelaar, focusing primarily on integrating terminology and knowledge graphs into neural machine translation architectures, alongside working on dialogue systems and natural language generation within the context of multi-modal data.</p>
