career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: I am a research fellow at Insight Centre for Data Analytics at the Data Science Institute (DSI) and Adjunct Lecturer Adjunct Lecturer at the School of Computer Science at NUI Galway. I am working in the Unit for Natural Language Processing (UNLP) under the supervision of Dr Paul Buitelaar, where my main research topic focuses on terminology and ontology translation with statistical as well as neural machine translation (SMT/NMT). I defended my PhD thesis with the title Machine Translation of Domain-Specific Expressions within  Ontologies and Documents. I studied the German Language at the University of Ljubljana, Slovenia, where I defended my Diploma thesis Named Entity Recognition for German and Slovene under the supervision of Dr Stojan Bracic and Dr Spela Vintar. In 2009 I obtained my master’s degree in Computational linguistics at the Ruhr University in Bochum, Germany. My thesis under the supervision of Prof. Dr Ralf Klabunde dealt with the extraction of semantic relations from the Slovene national corpus. After my study, I worked for Lionbridge as a developer of language technologies for Slovene, and for the Slovenian Project Communication in Slovene.

      - title: NURS
        link: "#hook"
        tagline: "The project focuses on neural machine translation (NMT) for under-resourced scenarios, i.e. languages or technical domains, using sequence-to-sequence models. To improve the translation quality within under-resourced scenarios, the work will involve data curation due to the code-mixing phenomena within the training data, terminology identification as well as linguistic injunction into the neural models."

        link: "https://elex.is/"
        tagline: "The ELEXIS project benefits from the expertise of some of the top experts in the fields of lexicography, linguistics and natural language processing, who agreed to share their experience and contribute their efforts to the success of the project."

      - title: MixedEmotions
        link: "#"
        tagline: "MixedEmotions will develop innovative multilingual multi-modal Big Data analytics applications that will analyze a more complete emotional profile of user behaviour using data from mixed input channels: multilingual text data sources, A/V signal input and structured data."

      - title: EuroSentiment
        link: "#"
        tagline: "The project aims to develop a large shared data pool for language resources meant to be used by sentiment analysis systems, in order to bundle together scattered resources."
