career-profile:
    title: Academic Profile
    summary:  <p align="justify"> I am a research fellow at Insight Centre for Data Analytics at the Data Science Institute (DSI) and Adjunct Lecturer Adjunct Lecturer at the School of Computer Science at NUI Galway. I am working in the Unit for Natural Language Processing (UNLP) under the supervision of Dr Paul Buitelaar, where my main research topic focuses on terminology and ontology/knowledge graph translation with neural machine translation. Recently, I am also following the work on dialogue systems and natural language generation with multi-modal data.</p>
